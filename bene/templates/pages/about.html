<h1>Name Story</h1>
<p>This is inspired by Benedetto Cotrugli who probably wrote the first manual on double entry book keeping.  The method
may have arisen independently around the world.  Luca Pacioli often gets the credit as his was the first book to be
printed in 1494 although he references Cotrugli's work of 40 years prior.  See
