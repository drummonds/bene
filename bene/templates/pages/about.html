    <h1>Name Story</h1>
    <p>
        This is inspired by Benedetto Cotrugli who probably wrote the first manual on double entry book keeping. The
        method
        may have arisen independently around the world. Luca Pacioli often gets the credit as his was the first book to
        be
        printed in 1494 although he references Cotrugli's work of 40 years prior. See
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Cotrugli">Wikipedia</a>.
